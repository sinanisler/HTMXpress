# WordPress + HTMX Theme Boilerplate

simple wordpress theme with htmx

posts, pages, post types, archives, categories, tags, taxonomies, permalinks, hierarchy, menus

the core idea is to implement hx-get natively on the theme and demonstrate the htmx with wp.


## Warning 
it is not fully implemented. yet....



## TODO
-  template hierarchy https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/
- it is possible to make all native wordpress hierarchy work on this.
- seo friendly
- permalink support
- block editor & site editor support ðŸ˜Ž
- simple page transitions examples ..etc



when it is ready I will create a demo site for this
with proper caching I am 100% sure this theme will work crazy fast
cant wait to try this on a regular hosting  ðŸ˜Ž
