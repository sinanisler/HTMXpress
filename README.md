# WordPress + HTMX Theme Boilerplate

idea is to create a bare minimum simple wp php theme with native htmx triggers

posts, pages, post types, archives, categories, tags, taxonomies, permalinks, hierarchy, menus


## Warning 
it is not fully implemented. yet....

## TODO
-  template hierarchy https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/
- it is possible to make all native wordpress hierarchy work on this.
- seo friendly
- permalink support
- block editor & site editor support ðŸ˜Ž
- simple page transitions ..etc



when it is ready I will create a demo site for this
with proper caching I am 100% sure this theme will work crazy fast
cant wait to try this on a regular hosting  ðŸ˜Ž
